## Task One: Web scraping to gain company insights <a name="task-one-web-scraping-to-gain-insights-on-british-airways"></a>
In this task, I scraped and analyzed customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways and presented my insights using PowerPoint. 
The primary outcomes of my analysis in the Jupyter Notebook have been shared in this document.

### Task One Presentation
The summary of my findings is in this [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t3U0xZN3LkQUJwjmig79yqjeHQZeOaM7pmPgfIpApdg/edit?usp=sharing). Within the slide, I've crafted visualizations and metrics to convey the findings effectively.

## Task Two: Predicting customer buying behavior <a name="task-two-predicting-customer-buying-behavior"></a>
In this task, I built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior.
