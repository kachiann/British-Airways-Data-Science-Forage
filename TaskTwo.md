## Task Two: Predicting customer buying behavior <a name="task-two-predicting-customer-buying-behavior"></a>
In this project, I developed a predictive model aimed at comprehending the key factors influencing consumer purchasing behavior. The primary objective of this model is to assist British Airways in strategically acquiring customers before their holiday journeys. By identifying and analyzing the factors that drive buying decisions, the model aims to enhance targeted marketing efforts and optimize customer acquisition strategies for holiday travel with British Airways. Here's a general outline of the process involved in building the predictive model:

- **Data Collection**: We need relevant data on customer demographics, travel preferences, past booking history, and any other factors that may influence buying behavior. This data can be collected from various sources, including customer surveys, online interactions, and historical sales data. For this task, here is the [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ObEzQLaiLNqu0zS2pDjD0DXQmsfBy9v8khPhLqu-qhw/edit?usp=sharing) used. 
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: To ensure the data quality and prepare the data for analysis we need to clean and preprocess it. This includes handling missing values, and outliers, and converting categorical variables into a suitable format for analysis.
- **Feature Selection and Engineering**
- **Model Selection and Training**: We will choose an appropriate predictive modeling technique based on the nature of our data and objectives. In particular, we will use **Random Forest**.
- **Model Evaluation**: In addition, we assess the performance of the model using validation datasets. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The primary outcomes of my analysis have been shared in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kachiann/British-Airways-Data-Science-Forage/blob/main/TaskTwo_final.ipynb).

### Task Two Presentation
Through carefully designed visualization incorporated within the [slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oYD48oYPiH5K-Er2OTeXrcDAnfuzjCXc/view?usp=sharing), I aim to effectively communicate and present the key findings. This presentation serves as a comprehensive overview of the insights derived from the study, providing a visually compelling and informative representation of the data and analysis.
