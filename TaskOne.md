## Task One: Web scraping to gain company insights <a name="task-one-web-scraping-to-gain-insights-on-british-airways"></a>
In this task, I scraped and analyzed customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways, then used PowerPoint to present my findings. Web scraping is the process of obtaining information from the Internet.
The project involed the following
- Scaping data from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/).
- Getting the site’s HTML code into a Python script so that one can interact with it. For this task, we’ll use Python’s requests library.
- Parsing HTML Code with Beautiful Soup, where Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing structured data.
- Analysing the data collected. Given that the collected data is messy and predominantly text-based, it is crucial to perform data cleaning to prepare the data for analysis.

In my analysis, I incorporated Word Cloud and Sentiment Analysis. Topic Modeling can also be considered for a more comprehensive analysis.

This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kachiann/British-Airways-Data-Science-Forage/blob/main/Task%20One_Final.ipynb) contains the primary findings of my analysis.

### Task One Presentation
The summary of my findings is in this [PowerPoint slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t3U0xZN3LkQUJwjmig79yqjeHQZeOaM7pmPgfIpApdg/edit?usp=sharing). Within the slides, I've crafted visualizations and metrics to convey the findings effectively.
